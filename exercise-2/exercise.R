# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"
CompareLength <- function(a, b){
  diff <- length(a)-length(b)
  final.val <- c("The difference in lengths is ", diff)
  return(paste0("The difference in lengths is ", diff))
}

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function


# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"


# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function


### Bonus ###

# Rewrite your `DescribeDifference` function to tell you the name of the vector which is longer
